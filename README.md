## Requirements
* This program was written in Python 3.9.1. The latest version of Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
* When installing Python, check the optional box that adds Python to PATH for easier access to our program.

## Running the program
1. Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the code from our [repository](https://github.com/Jen04/BunGeney).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder location where our repository is saved. Guides such as [this Windows guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/) or [this macOS guide](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html) can be helpful to learn terminal folder navigation.
4. After navigating to our program's folder in a terminal, type `python BunGeney.py` in the terminal to start the program.

## Using the program
Use the "New Litter" button to generate new rabbits. Litters can be created using new mother/father rabbits specified by user input, or by rabbits that have already been generated. The first litter requires user input.

The table at the top of the window consists of interactable buttons. Clicking on an individual rabbit button shows a picture of the rabbit and its description on the right side of the window. The "New parents __ and __" buttons are used as separators and do not affect the program when clicked.

The table at the bottom of the window is used to display a litter's statistics. To select a litter, click the litter's button in the top table. These buttons have the text "Offspring of bunnies __ and __". The statistics for a litter will automatically populate in the bottom table if a litter button is clicked.

All litters can be deleted using the "Clear All Litters" button at the top of the window.
